USingle README

This is what you need to run the app:
- an Android device with Android 5.1
- the device must allow installations for third party APK's

Program Description:

USingle is an app designed to match students from the same university of college.
These students are matched based on their interests and preferences. Initially,
when two students are matched, only their basic user information is shared. Their
profile pictures are not shared, but they may choose to show their Bitmojis. If
the students both accept each other as a match, more of their information is shared
and they have the option to message one another. They will also be given the option
to send Snapchat Bitmojis to each other.

Feel free to visit our website, which was made using Domain.com: www.usingleapp.com

After the user logs in or creates a new account, they are shown people that the app
has matched them with in the "New Matches" section. If they accept their match, they may develop their relationship
using the "People" section.

If we had the chance to continue working on our project, we would improve on the
"You" section of our app, in which the user can edit their profile. We would also
fix a bug where messages that are too long may not appear.

We hope you enjoy our Hackathon project!
